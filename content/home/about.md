# Biography

Natalia is Ass. Prof. of Artificial Intelligence at the Autonomous Systems and Robotics Lab (U2IS) at ENSTA ParisTech. She also belongs to the INRIA Flowers team on developmental robotics. Her research interests include deep, reinforcement and unsupervised learning, (state) representation learning, explainable AI and AI for social good. She is working on open-ended learning and continual/lifelong learning for applications in computer vision and robotics. Her background is on knowledge engineering (semantic web, ontologies and knowledge graphs) and is interested in neural-symbolic approaches to practical applications of AI. 

# Interns, PhD students and Postdocs wanted
